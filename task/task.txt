on user registration check if same username is not occupied, also on success registration add secretKey to user object
 
on user login (when good username and password provided) send user secretKey to front end
 
when user pokes other user send request to back end with user to poke username and own secretKey, by secret key you will find your user in users array and create records that you poked someone.
 
in user profile send secretKey to back end with (/getnotifications) request, to get notifications about who poked you
 
i do recommend to create separate array of notifications list in back end
