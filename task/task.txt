validations in back end:
username should start with upperCase letter
username should be min 4 max 20 length
 
age should be min 18 max 80 
 
gender could be two options:
male, female
 
race could be:
europe, african, asian, indian
 
(if race is other than mentioned, show error, also if race is asian selected, send message that asians is not allowed to use this application)
 
on each validations server should send error to front end, in front end you should show error to user, so it is clear what is wrong and what to change

make input with error to light up (red color or any other), so user would know which field was wrong, if all fields wrong, highlight all.

it will be easy if validations for inputs highlight will be done in front end. So front and back has same validations
