create backend logic:
1) user should be able to register. user provides username and password;
2) on registration respond success message or error message;
3) if user with same name exists, do not let register;

When user registers, let him login/
user should provide username and password, if username and password correct, return whole user object as response, if not correct, write error message, what is wrong (for example: bad username)
