create 3 modules.

1 module will get random cat image from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-cat-img

2 module will get name for animal using faker

3 module will get location from faker

connect all of these modules in app js, and make output to be string which gets values from objects you got from modules. Something like:

"My cat name is -NAME- ,we live in -CITY-, here is image of my cat: -IMAGE URL-"
